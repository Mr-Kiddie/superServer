today's task : read material about pipe

1.first problem 
linux net code p77 I wanna impliment the function to test7.c.
but i failed
The problem is I can't see anything in the output file.
Let me check it.

Em, I think it's my fault. The second parameter should be a command instead of a file......... The correct use: ./7.out more test7.c
