today's task : read material about pipe, named pipe, and lock 
Tomorrow's task : info sequence


1.first problem 
linux net code p77 I wanna impliment the function to test7.c.
but i failed
The problem is I can't see anything in the output file.
Let me check it.

Em, I think it's my fault. The second parameter should be a command instead of a file......... The correct use: ./7.out more test7.c

2. named pipe
 let's see the two files  test8.c  test9.c
 test8.c is the server  test9.c is the client.
test9.c send the data to the test8.c
It's pretty cool~

3. second problem  It's about the test 10.c
The test10.c has two essential fucntions : lseek() and sscanf()
I'm quite confuse about the line "if(!(n=sscanf(buff,"%d\n",&seqno)))"
and always get wrong answer. Then I find that we should write a number in the file "data". What a stupid guy.....

4. third problem 
   When I finish the problem in the page 83.. I got a totally different result from the book. I'm quite confuse. Then I find that no matter how I start the process. It's pid always the same. even if I start as ./test10.out &&./test10.out. I still find there is only one task work........ I didn't solve it ..

5. about the lock
   We have several method to lock the process. We just need to complete the two functions  my_lock(int fd)  and my_unlock(int fd)
