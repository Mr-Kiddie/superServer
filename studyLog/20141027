Learn protect process
In the os,we need create some special process which run at the background. Thus they would not be interuped by terminal.

when the back-process wanna show any process. It would send the message to the syslog() instead of the std out. We should check the message in the log of the system.

1.create process
 we should create a process and kill the parent one. We should ignore the sighup singal and fork a new process. Then we should change the work direction to make sure we could open the process wherever we are.After that , close all file handles to avoid comflict.Finally , open log system.

2. signal
  signal has two parameters. The first one is the type of the signal. The second one is the handler. The handler can be the address of a function which return a number.If the handler is SIG_IGN, it means we should ignore the signal. Or the handler is SIG_DFL , it means recover the default operation of the signal.

3. use alarm and pause
see test3.c 
The main function of the program is that we enter the time we need to wait and the string we'd like to show.
In this test. we use the signal(SIGALRM,setflag) and the setflag() function.
